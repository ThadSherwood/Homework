# Readme notes for homework

I do not have any real world experience python other than a few intro and 101 classes I have taken on basic syntax.  Instead of python, I imported the the CSV into SQL and ran queries against the data.
Attached in the repository you will find the results and queries for the three associated tasks from the homework.

Because the Data was more than 30 days since the last returned results, I wrote two queries for each task. One that I wrote to get the actual results because the dynamic query would not work since there is no data in the last 30 days, and the other being what the dynamic query would be if there was data within the last 30 days.
